<h3>Welcome to the KFramework homepage!</h3>

<p>
    The KFramework is a project being constructed by one person as a way of learning.
    The goal of the KFramework project is to provide those who wish to create web sites
    the ability to do just that in a nice and easy manner. The KFramework is being
    built to work as a small independent collection of files that can be expanded
    on with modules and extensions. Once the framework reaches a stable point and
    the module features have been added, the opportunity opens up for members of the
    public to start creating their own modules. I hope to provide easy of use when
    adding extensions by creating a drag and drop interface with a control panel
    to edit the settings.

    There is a lot planned for the KFramework and I am excited to finally be able
    to work on it full time.
