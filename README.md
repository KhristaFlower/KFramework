#KFramework

###What is it?

The KFramework is PHP based web framework designed to make the creation of sites nice and smooth by providing users the ability to quickly and easily install modules onto the site. These modules could be anything from blogs, forums, guestbooks to even galleries. The purpose is to also make it as easy as possible for other developers to make their own extensions that can be shared with other framework users.

###Why build it?

The KFramework is a personal learning project for me, I like to build all sorts of web applications for nothing other than the joy. By creating my own system I can come to learn how to implement and use an MVC architecture in an object orientated way but also ending up with a framework that allows for faster future development.

###What is the end-goal?

I hope that I can make the framework feature complete in a way that it offers not only myself but others too the grounds to develop content rich applications in a way that works for us. If anyone learns anything from this framework then that works for me too, alternatively I am more than happy to hear about all the ways I can improve the work I have already done.
